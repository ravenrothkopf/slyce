\section{Installation}
 To run the type checker, first compile \texttt{slyce} using \texttt{stack build}. 
 Then, to run \texttt{slyce} on a source file, such as \texttt{hello.sly}
 located in the \texttt{/examples} subdirectory, execute the
 command\newline\centerline{\texttt{stack exec slyce -- -t ./examples/hello.sly}}\newline
\texttt{-t} is an optional flag that prints the signatures of the checked
definitions. There is also \texttt{-s} for printing the scanned tokens, and
\texttt{-p} for printing the parsed module.
 If the file failed to scan, parse, or type check, \texttt{slyce} 
will print an informative error message, complete with the source positions of
where the error occurred.
