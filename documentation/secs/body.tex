\section{Our approach}
Our implementation process for \texttt{slyce} was iterative, and consisted of four main components when tackling any given feature.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Read \texttt{pi-forall}'s documentation on the specific feature we sought to implement
    \item Attempt to implement the feature while referencing the documentation
    \item Check our approach with Weirich's source code
    \item Test our additions and debug (alot)
\end{enumerate}

Following the style of the \texttt{pi-forall} tutorial, we began with a simple, core language without any bells and whistles.
Our first iterations of \texttt{slyce} were without error messages or a parser.
Thus, step \textbf{5} of the implementation process was primitive in the at first. 
We began with simply loading our modules into Haskell's \texttt{ghci} environment and testing from there.
As we progressed farther in the tutorial and type checking features built in complexity, we added these tools.
This process ensured that we deeply understood the foundation of our type checker before we began to add new, more involved features. 

The core theories behind dependent type checking in \texttt{slyce} largely mirror that of \texttt{pi-forall}.
Weirich's tutorial covers the theory and leaves all the other features that must come with a dependent type checker up to interpretation.
For that reason, we diverge the most from \texttt{pi-forall} in our parser and error checking approaches, though upon reflection in Section~\ref{reflection}, we wish we had implemented our parser in the \texttt{pi-forall} style from the beginning.

\section{Dependent types}
The key feature showcased in \texttt{slyce} is dependent type checking.
